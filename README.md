# my-cosmos-projects
A repository to document my learning about Cosmos (aka Interchain).

## Learning Journey
- [Interchain Developer Academy](https://ida.interchain.io/)
    - The content of Interchain Developer Academy is not fully available to the public. However, some of the content that is available to the public can be found in [Cosmos Developer Portal Tutorial](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/).
    - This repository contains the raw course content from the website (converted from *.mhtml* to *.docx*), projects and quizzes.
    - As Week 1 quiz report is not available yet, it is not certain that all the answers in the quiz are correct. Thus, not academic advice (NAA) XD!
    - Final Exams' content are not shared as we are told not to.

## Common CLI Commands
- To see available Ignite commands
    ```
    ignite
    ```
- To verify version of Ignite CLI
    ```
    ignite version
    ```
- To scaffold a chain that is placed under a GitHub path
    ```
    ignite scaffold chain github.com/<GitHub path>/<chain name>
    ```
    e.g.
    ```
    ignite scaffold chain github.com/alice/checkers
    ```
- Start a local testnet with a running node (use previous saved state)
    ```
    ignite chain serve
    ```
- Start a local testnet with a running node (clean state)
    ```
    ignite chain serve --reset-once
    ```
- To see available commands of a scaffolded chain
    ```
    <chain name>d --help
    ```
    e.g.
    ```
    checkersd --help
    ```
- To use scaffolded chain's command
    ```
    <chain name>d <chain command>
    ```
    e.g.
    ```
    checkersd status
    ```
- To compile .proto files
    ```
    ignite generate proto-go
    ```
- To run stateless unit test (not related to blockchain's state)
    ```
    go test github.com/<GitHub path>/<chain name>/x/<chain name>/types
    ```
- To run stateful unit test (related to blockchain's state)
    ```
    go test github.com/<GitHub path>/<chain name>/x/<chain name>/keeper
    ```
- To run integration test
    ```
    go test github.com/<GitHub path>/<chain name>/tests/integration/<chain name>/keeper
    ```
- To store variables as environment variables
    ```
    export <environment variable>=$<value or command that generate the value>
    ```
    e.g.
    ```
    export alice=$(checkersd keys show alice -a)
    ```
- To create mocks using the *mockgen*
    ```
    mockgen -source=x/<chain name>/types/expected_keepers.go \
        -package testutil \
        -destination=x/<chain name>/testutil/expected_keepers_mocks.go
    ```
- To use Go relayer, see [Go Relayer](https://ida.interchain.io/hands-on-exercise/5-ibc-adv/1-go-relayer.html).
- To use Hermes relayer, see [Hermes Relayer](https://ida.interchain.io/hands-on-exercise/5-ibc-adv/2-hermes-relayer.html).

## Tips
- If project's binary cannot be called after using ```ignite chain serve``` in the ignite project folder, it may be because the *GOPATH* is not set. Ensure that *PATH* contains *GOPATH* by appending the following to your profile, bashrc, zshrc or equivalent:
    ```
    export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
    ```
- To reset ```ignite chain serve```, use
    ```
    ignite chain serve --reset-once
    ```
- To installing Node.js dependencies and ```npm install``` hangs at ```sill: idealTree build```, try deleting *node_modules* and *package-lock.json* and then run
    ```
    npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/
    npm install
    ```
- To add a Git repository inside another Git repository as a submodule, use
    ```
    git submodule add <git clone link> client
    ```
    e.g.
    ```
    git submodule add git@github.com:cosmos/academy-checkers-ui.git client
    ```

- When using ```ignite scaffold ...``` commands, many files will be updated. To ensure rollback of changes, make sure to
    ```
    ***Commit previous changes first***
    git add .
    git commit -m "<commit message>"

    ***Scaffold***
    ignite scaffold <options>

    ***Rollback***
    git log
    git reset --hard <commit hash as seen from 'git log'>
    git clean -f -x
    ```
